redux 3 core concepts

cake shop scenario   =>  Redux     => purpose
Shop                  => Store    => holds the state of the application
Intention to buy cake => Action   => Describes the changes in the state of the application
Shopkeeper            => Reducer   => ties the store and actions together/carries out the state changes depending on the action

The redux principles
1. the state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store
    i.e maintain our app state in a single object which would be managed by the redux store
2. the only way to change the state is to emit an action , an object describing what happened
3. to specify how the state tree is transformed by actions , you write pure reducers
